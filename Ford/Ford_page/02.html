                    <p>The Ford F-150 is by far the most popular and best-selling vehicle in the United States.
                         Since its introduction way back in the late 1940s, 
                         the Blue Oval has sold well north of 34 million units
                          of the F-Series in the States. While the F-150 has 
                          always had an internal combustion engine (petrol or diesel), 
                          times are a-changing! The American auto giant has now revealed 
                          the all-new Lightning – a fully electric version of the regular F-150 
                          pickup. Given its extensive success in the country, the automaker is 
                          confident that the F-150 Lightning will be a hit with its customers.
                          The F-150® is purpose-built from the ground up — designed to be tough and productive. \
                          This is what happens when you merge premium-grade muscle with 
                          finely tuned intelligence and design. A beast with brains. A 
                          relentlessly tough, high-strength, military-grade, aluminum-alloy 
                          body and torture-tested high-strength steel frame with new tech to 
                          help you work smart and hard.

                    <p>A brutal Texas sun had sent temperatures soaring to record highs as I climbed into my dark-blue Ford F-150 Lightning Platinum edition. I’d been waiting for this opportunity for more than a year, ever since Chief Engineer Linda Zhang took me out for a ride at the Ford Proving Grounds north of Detroit.

                        Ford was early to electrify its lineup, offering up a mix of hybrids, plug-ins (PHEV), and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). But the original offerings didn’t fare all that well, especially all-electric models like the Focus EV. They were slow, stodgy, and offered marginal range.
                        
                        But the automaker found religion a few years back when company officials created Team Edison, which, essentially, was assigned the task of taking on Tesla. Its first project, the Mustang Mach-E, is now one of the bestselling BEVs in the U.S.

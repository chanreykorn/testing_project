                        Steve Marshall Ford Lincoln has been providing the people 
                        of Nanaimo, Duncan, and Victoria with new and used Ford 
                        vehicles – including the Escape, for years. We love connecting 
                        our community’s drivers with the perfect Ford for their needs, 
                        and that’s why we offer one of the largest selections of new and 
                        used Ford vehicles in the area. It’s also why we insist on having 
                        one of the friendliest and most knowledgeable teams available. When 
                        buying a new or used Ford Escape, we believe that few dealerships 
                        in the Duncan, Victoria, or Nanaimo area can meet our exacting standards. 
                        Revisit us down the road to take advantage of our wide range of after-sale 
                        services, from oil changes to routine maintenance all the way up to full 
                        engine restoration. We look forward to seeing you here again soon!
                    </p>

                    <h1>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="ditell_sub">
                    <p>Whether it’s in Duncan, Victoria, or right here in Nanaimo, there’s nothing quite 
                        like a new or used Ford Escape under your feet. It is a modern and refreshing SUV 
                        with a bold look that is sure to turn heads and drop jaws at nearly 
                        every intersection. The new versions are completely redesigned with 
                        bold and aerodynamic lines that draw the eye and further reduce drag. 
                        These new models also come with an available panoramic vista roof, and 
                        returning features like the 60/40 split fold-flat rear seat continue to 
                        provide even more cargo space and convenience. However, what truly sets a new or 
                        used Ford Escape apart from the other vehicles on the roads of Nanaimo, 
                        Duncan or Victoria is its versatility. Right from the word go, the Escape 
                        comes with a host of options, including four different powertrains to choose 
                        from. It boasts advanced safety features like Active Park Assist 2.0 and even 
                        gives entertainment options like the ten-speaker B&O Sound system. In more ways 
                        than one, the Ford Escape is perfect for the driver looking for a bespoke experience. 
                        So, if that sounds like you, come and see us here at Steve Marshall Ford Lincoln 
                        today for a test drive. We are confident that we have an Escape that will be the 
                        perfect complement to your life!

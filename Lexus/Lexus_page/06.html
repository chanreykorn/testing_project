                    <p>The ES has been around long enough that almost everyone knows the role it plays in the Lexus lineup. 
                        It's a conservatively styled, nicely appointed luxury sedan offering a wide array of trims and several 
                        powertrain options, all at a reasonable price point. The ES is propelled by either a four-cylinder, a 
                        V-6, or a four-cylinder hybrid powertrain; the latter delivers outstanding fuel economy. All-wheel 
                        drive is available on selected models. The interior is stylish, roomy, and comfortable, the ride is 
                        soft, and driver engagement is purposely not on the menu. Based on the same mechanicals as the Toyota 
                        Camry, the Lexus ES offers highly attractive pricing against cars like the Audi A6, BMW 5-series, and 
                        Mercedes-Benz E-class but it lacks their more involving feel. It may not be a car for enthusiastic drivers, 
                        but the ES does excel at keeping its occupants well isolated from the road's rough spots—and for many buyers, 
                        that's more than enough.

                    <p>You can take the GX well off the beaten path, 
                        and as is expected of a Lexus, it behaves as though every 
                        component has been coated in silicone. But on pavement, 
                        the truck-like LX 570 is less enjoyable to drive. Check out our
                         full Expert Rating for all of the details.
                         The steering is shockingly heavy at parking lot 
                         speeds and overly light on the freeway, with 
                         poor on-center feel that makes it easy to drift from a 
                         straight line. The brakes are quite numb and can be hard to 
                         modulate at low speeds, exhibiting some grabbiness. In our testing, 
                         the big SUV made the 0-60 mph run in an acceptable 7.5 seconds. 
                         Other luxury SUVs feel livelier when you prod the gas pedal.
